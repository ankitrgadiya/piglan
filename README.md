# Pig Latin


> Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered,
> usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial
> consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and
> adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. The objective is to
> conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference
> to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or
> jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English
> connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language.
